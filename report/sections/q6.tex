\subsection*{Question 6}

Consider now the data from the $10$ experiments.

\textbf{a)} Fit, using \textbf{JAGS}, a hierarchical model with $\theta_k = \log{\alpha_k}$, $(k = 0, 1, 2)$ randomly varying between experiments. Report your results in a meaningful manner.

\textbf{b)} Compare your estimates (\textit{+ credible regions}) for the $\theta_k$ parameters associated to experiment $1$ in this hierarchical model with the ones obtained in Q5.

\textbf{c)} Sample the predictive distribution of the number of cells at time $t = +\infty$ for experiment 1 using the hierarchical model and report a point estimates and a credible interval for that quantity. Compare your results with answers in Q5b.
