\subsection*{Question 5}

Sample $p(\bm{\theta}|\mathcal{D}_1)$ using \textbf{JAGS} with the same number of iterations (after burnin) as in Q3.

\textbf{a)} Compare your results with the previous ones.

Fitting a JAGS model, we now correctly estimate the growth rate of the number of cancer cells over time as we can notice on the plot below.

\textbf{b)} Sample the predictive distribution of the number of cells at time $t = +\infty$ and report a point estimates and a credible interval for that quantity.
